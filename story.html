            <p class="lead">I love learning new skills. I am also happy to meet other people who are exploring and challenging the limits of what they can do. I believe that there is no limit to learning. I have an old background in software development. I used to code
                using Visual Basic. It was the only programming language I know when I graduated college since we used it heavily on our thesis. I remember how eager I was to solve a logical problem when I am dealing with programs. I was also given the
                chance to teach it and help students get through their thesis in college. I migrated to the United States in 2009 and it took me a while to get my feet back into the IT industry. I worked in the Consulting Industry for over 5 years, working
                in IT and Security Compliance. I am currently working as a Cybersecurity Analyst at a retail corporation. I am enjoying this job and I would like to expand my skills in the software development in order to combine it with my current skills
                therefore strengthening my aspirations of creating things that would provide protection of human data and privacy. My goal is to continue learning programming as much as I can. I always love to be a beginner. I treat myself as a beginner
                at all times in order for me to transfer the knowledge and skills to anyone with much more patience and eagerness. Aside from computing, I also have a passion for art. I love drawing, painting with mediums such as watercolor and oil paint.
                I am also an aspiring artist. I do have a long way to go in this industry. However, I only do it as a hobby.</p>
